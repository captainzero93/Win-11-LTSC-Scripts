# Win-11-LTSC-Scripts
Scripts for aveage users who like the LTSC version but have issues

## Setting a free lightweight Image Viewer ( No Microsoft Store, No Default Viewer )
Script that will associate it with supported types (for me this would not work automatically). 

Please note you may need [GhostScript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) for one or two of the formats.

### Recommended open-source Image Viewer 
[![ImageGlass](https://img.shields.io/badge/ImageGlass-Download-blue)](https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/releases)

Restart Windows;
If it still doesn't work, verify that the ImageGlass path is correct for your installation. The default is usually C:\Program Files\ImageGlass\ImageGlass.exe
